# handshakestealer
This is just a basic script that steals handshakes and cleans them this can then be used to crack them and steal wifi passwords, if you have any questions on running the script double click on the file and in the first few lines you will see how to run it.
This script is not very good this is beacouse this script was just me learing bash, the deauth script is very good though.
